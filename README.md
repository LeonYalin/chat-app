# Shopping Cart Project

This project is a web application that allows users to browse a list of products, add them to a shopping cart, and manage their selections. The application is built using TypeScript and React, and it provides a user-friendly interface for a seamless shopping experience.

## Features

1. **Product Listing:**
   - The web page displays a list of products retrieved from a remote server.
   - The products are presented in the form of a table for easy browsing.

2. **Sorting and Filtering:**
   - Users can sort the product list by name or price, in ascending or descending order.
   - Products can be filtered by category, allowing users to focus on specific types of products.

3. **Shopping Cart:**
   - Each product has an "Add to Cart" button that adds the product to the shopping cart.
   - Once a product is added to the cart, it cannot be added again until it is removed.
   - The shopping cart displays a table of added products with quantity adjustment buttons.

4. **Quantity Adjustment:**
   - In the shopping cart, each product has "+" and "-" buttons for users to increase or decrease the quantity.

5. **Total Price Calculation:**
   - The total price of all products in the cart is displayed at the bottom.
   - Shipping costs are considered in the total price calculation.

6. **Shipping Cost Rules:**
   - If the total value is less than $20, the shipping cost is $7.
   - If the total value is less than $40, the shipping cost is $5.
   - If the total value is $40 or more, shipping is free.

7. **Discount Coupons:**
   - Users can apply discount coupons for additional savings.
   - Supported coupon codes:
     - `freeShipping!`: Free shipping regardless of the total cost.
     - `APPL10`: 10% off all Apple products.
     - `AUDIO15`: 15% off all Audio products.
     - `ELEC25`: 25% off all Electronic products.
